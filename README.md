# Database Populater

Just for fun - this is a silly data generator to use for creating data to use to seed a database.  

Simply create how many data boxes you want (max is 50) and then select how many times you want the data to repeat.  

Data is generated, mad-libs style using arrays of adjectives and nouns.  
The following is an example:

<h2>The Beautiful Woman And The DJ</h2><h3>An unusual story about an uptight beautiful woman with 2 pregnant cats and a DJ with chickenpox. </h3>An unusual story about an uptight beautiful woman with 2 pregnant cats and a DJ with chickenpox.An unusual story about an uptight beautiful woman with 2 pregnant cats and a DJ with chickenpox.An unusual story about an uptight beautiful woman with 2 pregnant cats and a DJ with chickenpox.An unusual story about an uptight beautiful woman with 2 pregnant cats and a DJ with chickenpox.An unusual story about an uptight beautiful woman with 2 pregnant cats and a DJ with chickenpox.An unusual story about an uptight beautiful woman with 2 pregnant cats and a DJ with chickenpox.An unusual story about an uptight beautiful woman with 2 pregnant cats and a DJ with chickenpox.An unusual story about an uptight beautiful woman with 2 pregnant cats and a DJ with chickenpox.An unusual story about an uptight beautiful woman with 2 pregnant cats and a DJ with chickenpox.An unusual story about an uptight beautiful woman with 2 pregnant cats and a DJ with chickenpox.
